# Code to obtain data from a single Nexus file acquired using BL-4A at the SNS/ORNL and to write the data as single events into text and Python binary files. The code is written as a Jupyter notebook. The notebook must be run using a Mantid compatible kernal. The recommendation is for the user to use analysis.sns.gov to run the code. Once run, access to Mantid and analysis.sns.gov is no longer required. The intent of the code is to allow the user to transfer data as text and binary files to the user's local machine to enable the user to process and analyze the data as they wish.  The tutorial requires the user to provide the path to the "IPTS" directory for the proposal and the run number for which the data are desired, and an identfying string for the output files. The tutorial provides step-by-step information on what the code is doing to extract and write the data. The files written include the single event data for each condition for flippers on or off, the proton charge corresponding to the accelerator pulse of the event.  Events acquired when the accelerator current was more than 4-sigma from its mean over the duration of the run are discarded. Finally, some information corresponding to the instrument geometry and some sample environment characteristics of the experiment are written in a logfile. Work funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725.
