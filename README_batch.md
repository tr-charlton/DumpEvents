# Code to obtain data from multiple Nexus files acquired using BL-4A at the SNS/ORNL and to write the data as single events into text and Python binary files for each run. The code is written as a Jupyter notebook. The notebook must be run using a Mantid compatible kernal. The recommendation is for the user to use analysis.sns.gov to run the code. Once run, access to Mantid and analysis.sns.gov is no longer required. The intent of the code is to allow the user to transfer data as text and binary files to the user's local machine to enable the user to process and analyze the data as they wish.  The code requires the user to provide the path to the "IPTS" directory for the proposal and a list of run numbers entered into a string array for which the data are desired, and an identfying string for the output files. The code runs without further user interaction. The files written include the single event data for each condition for flippers on or off, the proton charge corresponding to the accelerator pulse of the event.  Events acquired when the accelerator current was more than 4-sigma from its mean over the duration of the run are discarded. Finally, some information corresponding to the instrument geometry and some sample environment characteristics of the experiment are written in a logfile. Work funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725.
